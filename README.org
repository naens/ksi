#+TITLE: The Ksi Project

* Description

This is the Ksi project, the purpose of which is to create a
library for CCP/M-86 and PC-DOS.  It's goal is to unify common
functions such as console, system, and file functions for
different languages.  It should work for ASM86 and PL/M on
CCP/M-86 and PC-DOS.

The function specifications should be the same for Z80-based
CP/M.

There can be different implementations: an assembly language
implementation, a PL/M implementation, that can vary based on the
operating system requirements and available libraries.
