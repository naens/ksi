#+TITLE: The Ksi Project

* Description
This is the Ksi project, the purpose of which is to create a library
for CCP/M and PC-DOS, and to write some application in the Assembly
language that use the library.

The motivation to make this project is to learn to code in Assembly,
which I think is an important skill.  Another thing, is to learn to
write programs with a good structure and an organization that makes
sense.  Very often I get lost in my own programs so that even me, I
cannot maintain it anymore.  This project is aimed to rectify this
defect.

* Documentation
The documentation generated from the ROBODoc comments is located in
the Github Pages at [[https://naens.github.io/ksi/][https://naens.github.io/ksi/]].
