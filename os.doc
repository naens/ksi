;  NAME
;    os -- Modules for functions that interact directly with the OS
;  DESCRIPTION
;    These are the functions that have to be implemented differently
;    for every Operating System.  In order to be able to be used
;    by code not dependent on a particular OS, the interface (the
;    input and output parameters) is the same and the behaviour has
;    to match as much as possible the function description.
