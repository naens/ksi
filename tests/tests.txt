About tests
===========

Tests will be stored in user area number 1.  There are several
groups of tests, each dealing with a particular module or a group
of functions of the module.  For example, in the module cons,
groups might be read functions, print functions, and so on.  Each
one of the groups has a 3 letters abbreviation, which is a part
of the file name.  The file name also has the number of the test
within a group, which is a 2-digit decimal number.

The format of the test file name is t-ggg-nn, where ggg is the
identifier of the group and nn is the number of the test.

Here are the groups in use:

| Group ID | Group description             |

|    cpc   | Console print character       |
|    cps   | Console print string          |
|    cpn   | Console print number          |
|    crk   | Console read key              |
|    crl   | Console read line             |
|    crn   | Console read number           |
